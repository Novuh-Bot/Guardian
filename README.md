A small bot built with a focus on moderation, but an emphasis on fun.


<b>Note</b>

I do not give you permission to run the bot yourself in any way, shape, or form. This includes downloading the bot and modifying it slightly, then claiming it as your own or claiming you built the bot yourself. The bot's code is opensource to provide examples to others, not to allow you to claim it.

<b>Need help?</b>
